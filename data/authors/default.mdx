Rhian holds a double degree in physics and astronomy from the University of Washington and is a recovering software-engineer-turned-author with a passion for epic fantasy and classic detective novels.

She lives in the pacific northwest with her husband, and loves punk rock, video games, and vietnamese food. She would much rather write about fantastical made-up characters than herself.

There is a high likelihood that there is a small black cat on her lap right now.
